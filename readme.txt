This is an implementation in C# of the HashLife algorithm, such as implemented in Golly and other very fast Life programs.  

It was partly to understand the algorithm and partly to see if it could be made fast in C#.  My current findings are it is not reasonable to implement it as fast as in C++...YMMV.
